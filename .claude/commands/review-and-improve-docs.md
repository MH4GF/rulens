Please conduct a detailed review of the work session, focusing particularly on the interaction patterns with the user, and improve the CLAUDE.md document.

Focus your analysis on the following points:

1. **User Intervention Pattern Identification**

   - Locations where the user provided correction instructions and their reasons
   - Specific situations where the user intervened with phrases like 'wait' or 'that's not right' during code generation
   - Instances where project rules or coding conventions were violated

2. **Learning from Behavioral Constraints and Redirections**

   - Constraints set by the user and the intentions behind them
   - Parts of the initial implementation approach that were changed by the user
   - Project-specific rules and patterns that must be adhered to

3. **Meta-Analysis for Improvement**
   - Patterns in areas where the user repeatedly intervened
   - Root causes of misunderstandings or incorrect assumptions
   - Additional information needed to deepen understanding of the project

Based on the above analysis, enhance CLAUDE.md in the following ways:

- Clear documentation of challenges faced and their solutions
- Detailed explanation of project-specific rules and how to apply them
- Guidelines to reduce miscommunication in future sessions
- Notes on precautions during code generation and verification methods
- Improvement points from an engineering perspective with specific implementation advice

Please ensure the document is practical and aligned with the engineer's workflow and expectations, with emphasis on concrete measures to prevent the same issues from recurring.
